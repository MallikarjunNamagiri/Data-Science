* Background

This tutorial will show you how to integrate =docker= into your data science workflow. =docker= is an open source tool that makes it easy to build, deploy and run applications using a container framework. If you do any of the following, you can use =docker= to make your life easier:

- share and reproduce your analysis
- run large scale data cleaning tasks
- build dashboards and publish models 

* Getting Started

Clone the repo to your machine

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
 git clone https://github.com/harnav/pydata-docker-tutorial.git
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this tutorial, we will go over three points

1. Running a container
2. Reproducible environments
3. Deploying models
